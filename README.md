# SpontaneousClassification
Classifier for spontaneous activity recorded from the ventral lumbar roots

SpontaneousClassification is a graphical user interface (GUI) software designed to characterize and classify episodes of spontaneous activity. The classification is done using a multilayer perceptron and was trained using data recorded from the lumbar ventral roots of neonatal mouse spinal cords (P0-P3).
Here is a guide to the files included in the package:
•	SpontaneousClassification.m is a Matlab file containing all of the code needed to run the GUI software. It can be modified.
•	SpontaneousClassification.exe is a standalone version of the m-file for the GUI for Windows. It cannot be modified. A Mac version will be made available soon.
•	Instructions on how to use the GUI software are in a .docx file and a .pdf file. 
•	DemoVideo is a video demonstration of how to use the basic components of the GUI software. It is available on youtube: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xc3hVC7_olg&feature=youtu.be
•	The demo file used in the video is Demo.abf. The .abf files in the original work were obtained using Clampex software (Molecular Devices, Sunnyvale, CA).
